		<p>When he could eat no more, the old man sighed, wiped his hands
			on his naked legs, and gazed out over the sea. With the content of a
			full stomach, he waxed reminiscent. “To think of it! I’ve seen this
			beach alive with men, women, and children on a pleasant Sunday. And
			there weren’t any bears to eat them up, either. And right up there on
			the cliff was a big restaurant where you could get anything you
			wanted to eat. Four million people lived in San Francisco then. And
			now, in the whole city and county there aren’t forty all told. And
			out there on the sea were ships and ships always to be seen, going in
			for the Golden Gate or coming out.</p>
		<p>And airships in the air—dirigibles and flying machines. They
			could travel two hundred miles an hour. The mail contracts with the
			New York and San Francisco Limited demanded that for the minimum.
			There was a chap, a Frenchman, I forget his name, who succeeded in
			making three hundred; but the thing was risky, too risky for
			conservative persons. But he was on the right clew, and he would have
			managed it if it hadn’t been for the Great Plague. When I was a boy,
			there were men alive who remembered the coming of the first
			aeroplanes, and now I have lived to see the last of them, and that
			sixty years ago.” The old man babbled on, unheeded by the boys, who
			were long accustomed to his garrulousness, and whose vocabularies,
			besides, lacked the greater portion of the words he used.</p>
