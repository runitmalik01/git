&lt;br/&gt;
absent express permission granted by Wealth4India to do so.  You may also &lt;br/&gt;
create a hyperlink to the home page of Wealth4India sites so long as the &lt;br/&gt;

Wealth4India offers various parts of the Service in RSS format so that users
&lt;br/&gt;

feed, proper attribution to 'Wealth4India' as the source, (d) your use or &lt;br/&gt;

redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden &lt;br/&gt;
Wealth4India's systems.  Wealth4India reserves all rights in the content of

the RSS feeds and may terminate any RSS feed at any time. &lt;br/&gt;
Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by
&lt;br/&gt;
Wealth4India immediately terminates said permission or license.  In order to
&lt;br/&gt;

its conflict of law provisions. You and Wealth4India agree to submit to the

personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county

enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver
of &lt;br/&gt;
such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a
court &lt;br/&gt;
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that
&lt;br/&gt;

reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain

&lt;br/&gt;
right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. &lt;br/&gt;
You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, 
&lt;br/&gt;
if it becomes necessary for Wealth4India to pursue legal action to enforce the 
&lt;br/&gt;
Terms of Use, you will be liable to pay Wealth4India the following amounts as
liquidated  &lt;br/&gt;
damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of Wealth4Indias' damages for 
&lt;br/&gt;
the specified breaches of the Terms of Use: &lt;br/&gt;
a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity; (2) &lt;br/&gt;
falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or
&lt;br/&gt;
entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about &lt;br/&gt;
another person without that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay &lt;br/&gt;
Wealth4India one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message. &lt;br/&gt;
This provision does not apply to messages that are lawful non-deceptive &lt;br/&gt;
parodies of public figures. &lt;br/&gt;
b. If Wealth4India establishes limits on the frequency with which you may &lt;br/&gt;
access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you
&lt;br/&gt;
agree to pay Wealth4India one hundred dollars ($100) for each message posted
&lt;br/&gt;
in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access Wealth4India in
&lt;br/&gt;
excess of such limits, whichever is higher. &lt;br/&gt;
c. If you send unsolicited email advertisements to Wealth4India email &lt;br/&gt;
addresses or through Wealth4India computer systems, you agree to pay &lt;br/&gt;
Wealth4India twenty five dollars ($25) for each such email. &lt;br/&gt;
d. If you post Content in violation of the Terms of Use, other than as
described  &lt;br/&gt;
above, you agree to pay Wealth4India one hundred dollars ($100) for each  &lt;br/&gt;
Item of Content posted.  In its sole discretion, Wealth4India may elect  &lt;br/&gt;
to issue a warning before assessing damages. &lt;br/&gt;
e. If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the &lt;br/&gt;
Terms of Use, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree
to &lt;br/&gt;
pay Wealth4India one hundred dollars ($100) for each and every Item of Conent
&lt;br/&gt;
posted in violation of the Terms of Use.  A Posting Agent will also be deemed an
agent  &lt;br/&gt;
of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the &lt;br/&gt;
"Principal"), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in &lt;br/&gt;
violation of the Terms of Use) agrees to pay Wealth4India an additional one
hundred &lt;br/&gt;
dollars ($100) for each Item of Conent posted by the Posting Agent on  &lt;br/&gt;
behalf of the principal in violation of the Terms of Use. &lt;br/&gt;
f. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise  &lt;br/&gt;
exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in  &lt;br/&gt;
violation of the Terms of Use without Wealth4India's express written
permission,  &lt;br/&gt;
you agree to pay Wealth4India three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day 
&lt;br/&gt;
on which you engage in such conduct. &lt;br/&gt;
Otherwise, you agree to pay Wealth4India's actual damages, to the extent such
&lt;br/&gt;
actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other  &lt;br/&gt;
provision of the Terms of Use, Wealth4India retains the right to seek the
remedy  &lt;br/&gt;
of specific performance of any term contained in the Terms of Use, or a
preliminary  &lt;br/&gt;
or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the 
&lt;br/&gt;
exercise of any power granted in the Terms of Use, or any combination thereof.
&lt;br/&gt;

Scope

This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information for our services on the Wealth4India websites. It applies generally to the Wealth4India.com website and other related websites where this policy appears in the footer of the page. Some Wealth4India-branded websites or websites we operate may be governed by separate privacy policies. The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears in the footer of each website.

Our subsidiaries’ and joint ventures’ privacy practices are similar to those described in this Privacy Policy. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices throughout the global Wealth4India community. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective on April 1, 2008.


Collection

You can browse our sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.

We may collect and store the following personal information:

    * email address, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers;
    * transactional information based on your activities on the sites (such as  buying, selling, item and content you generate or that relates to your account);
    * community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our sites, and correspondence sent to us;
    * other information from your interaction with our sites, services, content and advertising, including computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information;
    * information from other companies, such as demographic and traffic data; and


Marketing

We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate your preference once you sign-on in My Account (or similar account status page) or by following the directions provided in an email or from a link on the advertisement.


Use

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use your personal information to:

    * provide the services and customer support you request;
    * resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
    * prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;
    * customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising;
    * tell you about targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and
    * compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.


Our Disclosure of Your Information

We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.

We may also share your personal information with:

    * Members of our corporate family to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and provide joint content and services (for example, registration, transactions and customer support). Our corporate affiliates will send marketing communications only to users who request these services.
    * Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards).
    * Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).
    * Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, and listing history.
    * Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.


Activity Associated with User IDs

Your User ID is displayed throughout Wealth4India and is therefore available to the public. All of your activity on our sites is traceable to your User ID. Other people can see your items that you have purchased in the past, items for sale, feedback, ratings and associated comments, and so on.


Using Information from Wealth4India

Wealth4India enables you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions. When users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.

You agree to use user information only for:

    * Wealth4India transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages;
    * using services offered through Wealth4India (e.g. shipping and fraud complaints), or
    * other purposes that a user expressly chooses.


Cookies

"Cookies" are small files placed on the hard drive of your computer. We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. Wealth4India uses cookies, web beacons, and related tools provided by third parties to provide you with services that make the Wealth4India site more efficient for your buying and selling activities. Wealth4India limits the use of these tools to protect your privacy. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive once you end your session (log out or close your browser).

A few important things you should know about cookies are that:

    * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.
    * We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.
    * Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
    * You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services.
    * You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)

Wealth4India uses cookies on certain pages of the website to:

    * Allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.
    * Provide information that is targeted to your interests.
    * Promote and enforce trust and safety.
    * Offer certain features that are only available through the use of cookies.
    * Measure promotional effectiveness.
    * Analyze our web page flow.

Cookies on Wealth4India's discussion boards use session cookies to facilitate conversation threads and overall service functions.

Your choices about cookies – We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. You are always free to decline cookies if your browser permits. However, if you decline cookies, you may not be able to use certain features on the website, and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. Learn how to set your browser to accept cookies.

Web beacons

A web beacon is an electronic image placed in the web page code that can serve many of the same purposes as cookies. Web beacons are used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow.

How Wealth4India protects your privacy with third parties

    * Wealth4India may work with other companies who place cookies or web beacons on our websites. These companies help operate our websites and provide you with additional products and services. They are subject to confidentiality agreements with Wealth4India and other legal restrictions. Wealth4India does not permit any of these companies to collect personal information using cookies or web beacons on our websites.
    * Some of these companies like DoubleClick and MediaPlex — maybe our service providers who place cookies that help us serve our own content and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. We require these companies to use the information they collect only to provide us with these services under contract.
    * Wealth4India may participate in cookie-based ad networks operated by Yahoo and Tacoda. This means that these companies may use some anonymous information about you (based on a cookie on your computer) to display ads. We do not permit these companies to collect any personal information about you. Tacoda collects anonymous information using cookies to tailor the advertising you see on the Wealth4India sites or elsewhere on the web. Yahoo uses some anonymous information we send them (like age range and gender) to display ads on the Wealth4India sites. Yahoo may also use anonymous information about its own users to select ads to serve on our pages. Click these links to learn more about Yahoo’s{http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html} and Tacoda’s{http://www.tacoda.com/notice/privacy_policy.html} ad-serving business practices and privacy policies, including how to decline participation in these programs.
    * Wealth4India does not permit third-party content on Wealth4India (such as an item listing) to include cookies or web beacons, although this may still happen from time to time. If you believe a listing may be collecting personal information or using cookies, please report it to spam@Wealth4India.com.


No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing

We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your Wealth4India notification preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other Wealth4India users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report Wealth4India-related spam or spoof emails to Wealth4India, please forward the email to spam@Wealth4India.com or spoof@Wealth4India.com. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We occasionally scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.


Account Protection

Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Wealth4India password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Wealth4India and change your password.


Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information

You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to Wealth4India. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Wealth4India User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.


Security

Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.


Third Parties

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Wealth4India does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.


General

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site.
