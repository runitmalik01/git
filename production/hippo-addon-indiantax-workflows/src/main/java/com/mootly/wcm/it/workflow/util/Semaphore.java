/**
 * Base class for counting semaphores.
 * Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of permits.
 * Each acquire() blocks if necessary
 * until a permit is available, and then takes it.
 * Each release adds a permit. However, no actual permit objects
 * are used; the Semaphore just keeps a count of the number
 * available and acts accordingly.
 * <p>
 * A semaphore initialized to 1 can serve as a mutual exclusion
 * lock.
 * <p>
 * Different implementation subclasses may provide different
 * ordering guarantees (or lack thereof) surrounding which
 * threads will be resumed upon a signal.
 * <p>
 * The default implementation makes NO
 * guarantees about the order in which threads will
 * acquire permits. It is often faster than other implementations.
